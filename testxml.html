<p>1 August 2001: A <a href="Guide/xhtml-m12n-tutorial/">tutorial on XHTML
Modules and Markup Languages</a> is now available.
This tutorial explains how to create XHTML Family modules and markup languages,
based on <a href="#xhtml-modularization">Modularization of XHTML</a>.</p>

<p>8 June 2001: The third draft of the <a
href="../TR/2001/WD-xhtml-events-20010608/">XHTML Events</a>
specification has been published.
The XHTML Events module provides XHTML
host languages the ability to uniformly integrate event listeners
and associated event handlers with Document Object Model
(DOM) Level 2 event interfaces. The result is to provide XHTML
based languages an interoperable way of associating behaviors with
document-level markup.
In addition, this specification defines a subset of the XHTML Events
module called basic events for use on simpler client devices. Finally,
the XHTML Event Types Module defines the XHTML language event types.</p>

<h2><a id="whatis" name="whatis">What is HTML?</a></h2>

<p>HTML is the <em>lingua franca</em> for publishing hypertext on
the World Wide Web. It is a non-proprietary format based upon
<acronym title="Standard Generalized MarkUp Language">SGML</acronym>, and
can be created and processed by a wide range of tools, from simple plain
text editors - you type it in from scratch- to sophisticated <acronym
title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</acronym> authoring tools.
HTML uses tags such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
to structure text into headings, paragraphs, lists, hypertext links etc.
Here is a <a href="Guide/">10-minute guide</a> for newcomers to HTML. W3C's
statement of direction for HTML is given on the <a
href="Activity">HTML Activity Page</a>. See also the page on
our work on the <a href="Forms/">next generation of Web
forms</a>, and the section on <a href="#historical">Web
history</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="mission" name="mission">Mission of the HTML Working
Group</a></h2>

<p>To develop the next generation of HTML as a suite of XML tag
sets with a clean migration path from HTML 4. Some of the
expected benefits include: reduced authoring costs, an improved
match to database &amp; workflow applications, a modular solution
to the increasingly disparate capabilities of browsers, and the
ability to cleanly integrate HTML with other XML applications.
For further information, see the <a
href="2000/Charter">Charter</a> for the <a
href="Group/">HTML Working Group</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="recommendations" name="recommendations">Recommendations</a></h2>

<p>W3C produces what are known as "Recommendations" for HTML/XHTML.
These are specifications, developed by W3C working groups, and
then voted in by Members of the Consortium. A W3C Recommendation
indicates that consensus has been reached among the Consortium
Members that a specification is appropriate for widespread
use.</p>

<h2><a id="whatis" name="whatis">What is HTML?</a></h2>

<p>HTML is the <em>lingua franca</em> for publishing hypertext on
the World Wide Web. It is a non-proprietary format based upon
<acronym title="Standard Generalized MarkUp Language">SGML</acronym>, and
can be created and processed by a wide range of tools, from simple plain
text editors - you type it in from scratch- to sophisticated <acronym
title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</acronym> authoring tools.
HTML uses tags such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
to structure text into headings, paragraphs, lists, hypertext links etc.
Here is a <a href="Guide/">10-minute guide</a> for newcomers to HTML. W3C's
statement of direction for HTML is given on the <a
href="Activity">HTML Activity Page</a>. See also the page on
our work on the <a href="Forms/">next generation of Web
forms</a>, and the section on <a href="#historical">Web
history</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="mission" name="mission">Mission of the HTML Working
Group</a></h2>

<p>To develop the next generation of HTML as a suite of XML tag
sets with a clean migration path from HTML 4. Some of the
expected benefits include: reduced authoring costs, an improved
match to database &amp; workflow applications, a modular solution
to the increasingly disparate capabilities of browsers, and the
ability to cleanly integrate HTML with other XML applications.
For further information, see the <a
href="2000/Charter">Charter</a> for the <a
href="Group/">HTML Working Group</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="recommendations" name="recommendations">Recommendations</a></h2>

<p>W3C produces what are known as "Recommendations" for HTML/XHTML.
These are specifications, developed by W3C working groups, and
then voted in by Members of the Consortium. A W3C Recommendation
indicates that consensus has been reached among the Consortium
Members that a specification is appropriate for widespread
use.</p>

<h2><a id="whatis" name="whatis">What is HTML?</a></h2>

<p>HTML is the <em>lingua franca</em> for publishing hypertext on
the World Wide Web. It is a non-proprietary format based upon
<acronym title="Standard Generalized MarkUp Language">SGML</acronym>, and
can be created and processed by a wide range of tools, from simple plain
text editors - you type it in from scratch- to sophisticated <acronym
title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</acronym> authoring tools.
HTML uses tags such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
to structure text into headings, paragraphs, lists, hypertext links etc.
Here is a <a href="Guide/">10-minute guide</a> for newcomers to HTML. W3C's
statement of direction for HTML is given on the <a
href="Activity">HTML Activity Page</a>. See also the page on
our work on the <a href="Forms/">next generation of Web
forms</a>, and the section on <a href="#historical">Web

<h2><a id="mission" name="mission">Mission of the HTML Working
Group</a></h2>

<p>To develop the next generation of HTML as a suite of XML tag
sets with a clean migration path from HTML 4. Some of the
expected benefits include: reduced authoring costs, an improved
match to database &amp; workflow applications, a modular solution
to the increasingly disparate capabilities of browsers, and the
ability to cleanly integrate HTML with other XML applications.
For further information, see the <a
href="2000/Charter">Charter</a> for the <a
href="Group/">HTML Working Group</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="recommendations" name="recommendations">Recommendations</a></h2>

<p>W3C produces what are known as "Recommendations" for HTML/XHTML.
These are specifications, developed by W3C working groups, and
then voted in by Members of the Consortium. A W3C Recommendation
indicates that consensus has been reached among the Consortium
Members that a specification is appropriate for widespread
use.</p>
